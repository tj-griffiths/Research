The folder contains all my research work. As it currently stands, for two groups: UW Ion Trap & UW N-Body Shop.

N-Body Shop: 
Investigation of integration methods for systems with discontinuous forces, particularly Monte Carlo methods for modeling self-interacting dark matter. 
Developed and implemented advanced numerical integration methods for systems with discontinuous forces, focusing on leapfrog algorithm optimization. 
Created a comprehensive error analysis framework comparing numerical solutions against analytical predictions for varying stepsize.
Implemented drift correction mechanisms for improved accuracy in bounce dynamics and phase space trajectories. 

Ion Trap:
Characterized vapor pressure profiles of BaMg alloy (20% Ba, 80% Mg) as an alternative barium source for ion trap quantum computing. 
Integrated RGA mass spectrometry for real-time vapor composition analysis. 
Conducted systemic comparison of vapor production between pure barium and BaMg alloy, demonstrating comparable onset temperatures while reducing operation complexity
